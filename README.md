Azure Databricks End-to-End Retail Lakehouse
Overview
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering project on Azure Databricks using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold). The pipeline ingests raw retail data, refines it incrementally, and delivers analytics-ready dimension and fact tables using Delta Lake and Unity Catalog.

Business Use Case
Retail analytics platform enabling:

Sales and revenue analysis
Product price and category history tracking
Customer-based reporting
Time-based trend analysis (monthly / yearly)
Architecture
1748691271296

Key Characteristics
Incremental ingestion using Databricks Auto Loader
Parallel Silver and Gold processing
Append-only fact table design
SCD Type-1 and SCD Type-2 dimensional modeling
Tech Stack
Azure Databricks
Delta Lake
Unity Catalog
PySpark & Spark SQL
Auto Loader
Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2)
Data Layers
Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)
Incremental file ingestion using Auto Loader
Schema inference and append-only storage
No transformations
Silver Layer (Refined Data)
Data cleansing and standardization
Deduplication by business keys
Entity-specific transformations
Tables:

silver_customers
silver_orders
silver_products
Gold Layer (Business-Ready)
DimCustomers – SCD Type 1
Stores latest customer attributes
Updates overwrite existing values
No historical tracking
DimProducts – SCD Type 2
Tracks historical product changes
Uses effective start/end dates and current flag
Preserves full change history
FactOrders
Grain: one row per product per order
Append-only transactional fact table
Stores only business keys and measures
Dimensions joined at query time

Lakehouse best practices
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a production-style Azure Databricks Lakehouse implementation using industry-standard data engineering practices. It showcases the complete lifecycle of data—from raw ingestion to analytics-ready datasets—implemented through a scalable Medallion Architecture.

By combining Auto Loader–based incremental ingestion, Delta Lake transactional guarantees, Unity Catalog governance, and star schema modeling, the solution delivers a robust and maintainable analytics platform. The use of SCD Type 1 for Customers, SCD Type 2 for Products, and an append-only FactOrders table reflects real-world business requirements and best practices.

The pipeline is intentionally designed to be free-tier compatible, avoiding paid features while still adhering to enterprise-grade design principles. This makes the project both practically executable , demonstrating strong understanding of modern data engineering concepts, trade-offs, and architectural decisions.
